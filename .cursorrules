- Displays photos and memories during the wedding day
- Is usable by guests of all tech levels, especially on mobile devices

---

## üìã Requirements


During development:
- Prioritize mobile-first and responsive design
- Follow modular component architecture (especially for React)
- Keep the UI intuitive and minimalistic, with gentle animations
- Avoid unnecessary complexity; stick with lightweight tech unless a feature demands it
- Easy access: Guests will scan QR code to access the app directly
- Optimize for quick loading and instant usability after QR scan 

---

## üîÑ Requirement Clarification

- All goals and features are documented in `README.md`
- Major features:
  - Bubble Sign-in
  - Couple's Story
  - Blessing Wall
  - Photo Wall
- This file (`.cursorrules`) guides AI generation and keeps feature implementation aligned

---

## üí° User Needs Analysis

- Think from the wedding guest's POV (non-technical, mobile users)
- Minimize interaction steps; keep flows clear and delightful
- Feature priority order: Bubble Check-in ‚Üí Couple's Story ‚Üí Blessing Wall ‚Üí Photo Wall

## üé® Design System

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Use modern UI elements: cards, modals, buttons, and soft transitions
- Prefer soft/pastel colors with wedding-themed accents (e.g., hearts, petals)
- Maintain consistent styling and structure across all pages
- Keep the UI intuitive and minimalistic, with gentle animations

### Color Palette
- Primary: #FF6B9D (soft pink)
- Secondary: #4ECDC4 (mint green)
- Accent: #FFE66D (warm yellow)
- Background: #FFF8F0 (warm white)
- Text: #2C3E50 (dark blue-gray)

### Typography
- Headings: 'Playfair Display', serif (elegant)
- Body: 'Inter', sans-serif (clean, readable)
- Accent: 'Dancing Script', cursive (for special moments)

### Spacing & Layout
- Use consistent spacing scale: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px
- Mobile-first padding: 16px
- Touch targets: 44px minimum for all interactive elements
- Text sizes: 16px minimum for readability

---

## üß± Feature Development

- **Tech stack**:
  - JavaScript with optional React
  - HTML5/CSS3 with Flex/Grid layout
  - Animations via CSS or GSAP if needed
  - Deploy via Netlify
- **Code guidance**:
  - Keep components small and focused
  - Use `localStorage` for basic data persistence (e.g., sign-in names)
  - If backend is added later, consider Firebase
  - Follow semantic HTML structure
  - Implement progressive enhancement

---

## üîß Problem Solving

- When hitting roadblocks (e.g., dynamic animations or localStorage bugs), debug step by step and seek user clarity if behavior is ambiguous
- Suggest fallback options for features that don't work well on mobile
- Always provide error handling for user interactions
- Test edge cases (slow internet, old browsers, etc.)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimization

- Regularly review page loading, scroll smoothness, and animation FPS
- Avoid over-rendering or excessive DOM manipulation
- All optimization efforts should be reflected in the README or comments
- Optimize images for web (WebP format, lazy loading)
- Minimize bundle size and HTTP requests

---

## üìê Methodology

- **System design**: Modular components ‚Üí App ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Feature folders
- **Iterative build**: Start with working skeleton, layer in features weekly
- **Clean code**: Comment complex logic, and keep CSS reusable via utility classes
- **UI preview testing**: Test each feature with at least 2 devices (mobile + desktop)
- **Version control**: Commit frequently with descriptive messages

---



---

## üì± Mobile-Only Design

- **Target Devices**: Mobile phones only (no desktop testing needed)
- **Screen Sizes**: 320px - 428px (iPhone SE to iPhone 14 Pro Max)
- **Orientation**: Portrait mode optimized
- **Touch Targets**: 44px minimum for all interactive elements
- **Text Sizes**: 16px minimum for readability
- **Offline Ready**: Consider poor venue WiFi connectivity

---

## üöÄ Development Workflow

1. **Planning**: Review requirements and create component structure
2. **Prototyping**: Build basic HTML/CSS structure
3. **Functionality**: Add JavaScript interactions
4. **Polish**: Add animations and micro-interactions
5. **Testing**: Cross-browser and device testing
6. **Deployment**: Netlify deployment and monitoring

---

## üêõ Debugging Guidelines

- Use browser dev tools for debugging
- Console.log strategically for state tracking
- Test localStorage functionality manually
- Validate HTML and CSS regularly
- Check mobile performance with Chrome DevTools

---

## üìù Code Standards

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic and business rules
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use template literals for dynamic content
- Implement error boundaries for React components

### Code Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract reusable components and functions
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Avoid over-engineering solutions
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/component should do one thing well
- **Consistent Naming**: Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- **Modular Design**: Break complex features into smaller, manageable pieces

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

- App loads in under 3 seconds
- All features work on iOS Safari and Chrome Mobile
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Accessible to screen readers
- Guests can complete check-in in under 30 seconds

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy
